# Implementation of Univariate Linear Regression
## Aim:
To implement univariate Linear Regression to fit a straight line using least squares.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y.
2.	Calculate the mean of the X -values and the mean of the Y -values.
3.	Find the slope m of the line of best fit using the formula.

4.	Compute the y -intercept of the line by using the formula:
![eqn2](./eq2.jpg)  
5.	Use the slope m and the y -intercept to form the equation of the line.
6.	Obtain the straight line equation Y=mX+b and plot the scatterplot.
